## Usage Example ‚å®Ô∏è

After installing Fluky, you should start by importing the framework:

```swift
import Fluky
```

Once imported, you can start using Fluky to create randomized icon based loading sceens. Bellow, you'll be able to see a working example. First, we start by creating a `FlukyView`:

```swift
let flukyView = Fluky.view(as: .single, with: images) 
// size has a default parameter of 30.0
```

Once you apply your constraints, to start animating you just need to do:

```swift
flukyView.start()
```

In order to stop you just do:

```swift
flukyView.stop()
```

With the goal of being as customizable as possible, Fluky only creates a `FlukyView` responsible for managing the icons and its animations. With this in mind, it should be added to your view hierarchy where you can customize `backgroundColor`, add a `UILabel` & others.
